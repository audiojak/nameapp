    "We measure developers by productivity and engagement enabling us to put them into 4 categories, engaged/productive, unengaged/productive, engaged/unproductive, and unengaged/unproductive. By putting developers into these categories, we can create actionable insights for software development managers,  VPs of engineering, and other engineering leadership.",
    "We measure productivity by ingesting all code changes and processing them with an LLM to answer the question, if an average senior developer had written this code, how long would it take. We use this score to stack rank developers. We also summarize the changes in the code to give managers talking points with the developer.",
    "We measure engagement through anonymous feedback at an individual level and surveys at a team level. We gather anonymous feedback in a vector database vector embeddings for each piece of feedback. When a piece of feedback comes in, we check if the person receiving the feedback has received at least 3 pieces of similar feedback from three different people in the past 3 months. If they have, we summarize and anonymize the feedback and give it to their manager to pass on.",
    "We have a desktop tool that enables developers to give feedback, answer survey questions, and answer data enrichment questions simply and quickly."

  keyMessages: [
    "6-month performance reviews based on 360 feedback are time-consuming and ineffective. VPs of engineering struggle to find top performers and quiet quitters. Software engineering managers spend months each year pulling together data for performance reviews and promotion documents. Many of the best developers leave before they receive promotions that they are due. Disengaged developers become a net negative organizations for months before managers realize.",
    "Developers hate arbitrary metrics, but they love justice. They want to be recognized for hard work and they hate working with slackers that hold the team back.",
    "Even when all of your engineering managers are brilliant, they all measure software developer productivity differently. This makes it impossible for the VP of engineering to objectively understand productivity across their organization.",
    "People's biggest fear when giving feedback is that they will be found out. This stops them from giving candid feedback for fear of retribution.",
    "Survey's only work when they are not an inconvenience for people. They need to be quick to answer and they need to appear when they are not going to disrupt work.",
    "We help managers broach hard topics with relevant aggregated feedback and make them open topics that can be discussed freely",
    "Our customers start a flywheel of feedback within their organization. Once staff realize that feedback is having an effect, they give more and more feedback. Coaching on aggregated feedback puts people in touch with the needs of their peers, reports, and managers. This creates a culture of open communication where previously unspoken topics are discussed freely."

  stories: [
    "One startup go on to a demo call and then wanted to on-board immediately because they got the concept. We ingested their data and were showing them outliers in their organization in 10 mins.",
    "We jumped on a call with an HR leader and the instantly loved the concept of truly anonymous feedback. They had to make a hard decision recently between a new system of anonymous feedback or going toward radical candor. They said that if they had had the option of our tool at the time, they would have chosen it in a heartbeat. They completely get how we create a culture of open communication."

  vision: [
    "We will change the way organizations think about performance by enabling continuous performance management.",
    "Customers will get rid of 6-month performance reviews in favor of hour by hour performance and engagement data that will enable them to promote people quickly and without data-gathering."
